Alongside the enrichment of the OpenStreetMap database over the years, numerous 
tools have been developed to interact with or to create derivative products: 
editors, data extraction tools, geocoding services, slippy maps, or routing engines. 
Most of these tools are accessible via scripting languages through APIs or dedicated libraries. 
Among these languages, R stands out as a free and open source programming 
language and software for statistical computing and data visualization. 
Complemented by more than 23,500 user-contributed packages hosted on the 
Comprehensive R Archive Network in 2026, the language’s versatility allows users 
to build unified workflows within an environment conducive to reproducible research. 
R is widely used for research purposes in many fields beyond statistics, 
such as biology, social sciences, or geomatics. A subset of its packages 
forms a robust and mature spatial ecosystem that makes it easy to handle and 
display spatial data. Consequently, R provides seamless access to various APIs 
and tools for downloading and filtering OpenStreetMap data, querying shortest 
routes and itineraries, or generating both static and interactive maps.

As part of our research activities, we have developed some of the key 
OpenStreetMap-related R packages. For example, the `osrm` package has enabled 
the integration of time-distance calculations in many academic studies by providing 
a straightforward access to the OSRM routing engine. The package has been widely 
used in numerous published papers across various disciplines (health, transport, 
environmental science, or education). Thus, we argue that R enables researchers 
to efficiently use OpenStreetMap thanks to a unified and reproducible environment 
and specialized packages.

In this presentation, we first explore a curated selection of R packages designed 
to interact with the OpenStreetMap database. We begin with packages that download 
and extract data, such as `osmextract` and `osmdata`. Then, we explore solutions 
that interface third party softwares for geocoding (Nominatim with `tidygeocoder`) 
and routing (OSRM with `osrm`, Valhalla with `valh`). Finally, we address dynamic 
cartography (using `leaflet`) and creation of static maps from raster tiles 
(using `maptiles`) or from vector objects (using `maposm`).

To illustrate the practical application of these tools, we conclude with a short, 
seamless and fully reproducible example. From the geocoding of an address, 
to the extraction of amenities or the use of routing engines and till the creation 
of a publication-ready map, we propose a complete workflow that harness the power 
of R ecosystem to create insightful analysis from OpenStreetMap data.
